# AntiAuthMath

Motivation
----------
“Doing mathematics should always mean finding patterns and crafting beautiful and meaningful explanations.”  ― Paul Lockhart from A Mathematician's Lament: How School Cheats Us Out of Our Most Fascinating and Imaginative Art Form

What
----
We build worksheets for an AnitAuthoritarian approach to Math.
Math is not numbers nor remembering rules: Math is the art of explanation.
We use Python and especially reportlab.py to build 'black line master' PDF worksheets.

Theory of AntiAuthMath Worksheets
---------------------------------
Each worksheet is one page.
It is nice to have at least two levels of verbosity for each worksheet.
  The verbose=0 worksheet is as empty as possible.
  The verbose=9 worksheet has full prompts and solutions.
A good worksheet wants a first prompt of, 'Behold!', followed by prolonged silence.
It is fun to have intermediate verbosities, especially with a random component.
It is fun to make worksheets that are gamifiable, for one or more.
