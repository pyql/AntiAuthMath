# AntiAuthMath

What
----
We build worksheets for an AnitAuthoritarian approach to Math.
Math is not numbers nor remembering rules, math is the art of explanation.
We use Python and especially reportlab.py to build 'black line master' PDFs.

Theory of AntiAuthMath Worksheets
---------------------------------
Each worksheet is one page long.
It is polite to have at least two levels of verbosity for each worksheet.
The verbose=0 worksheet is as empty as possible.
The verbose=9 worksheet has all the prompts and the full solution and is one page long.
A good first prompt is, 'Behold!', followed by prolonged silence.
It is fun to have intermediate verbosities, especially with a random component.
